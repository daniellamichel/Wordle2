# Project 2 - *Wordle 2*

Submitted by: **Daniella Michel**

**Wordle 2** is an iOS Swift-based clone of the popular word puzzle game, with extra knobs you can tweak. Players attempt to guess a hidden word; after each full-row guess, the app provides visual feedback using colored tiles:

- üü© **Green** ‚Äî correct letter in the correct position  
- üü® **Yellow** ‚Äî correct letter, wrong position  
- ‚¨õ **Gray** ‚Äî letter not in the word

This version lets you choose the **word length (4‚Äì7 letters)**, the **number of guesses**, and a **theme** for the goal word. There‚Äôs also **Alien Wordle** mode where the goal word changes after each full-row guess. The interface uses UIKit with custom `UICollectionViewCell`s; the game auto-submits a row once it‚Äôs filled (no Enter key), and includes a top-left **Reset** button that clears the board without changing current settings.

Time spent: **15** hours in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] *(Add any extras you build later!)*

## Notes

- Initially saw ‚Äúno colors‚Äù because the **goal word length** didn‚Äôt match the selected letters-per-row; fixed by ensuring the generated goal always matches `numItemsPerRow`.
- Resolved settings lookups by using the settings dictionary keys in code where constants were unavailable.
- Minor Git issues (divergent histories, README conflict) were resolved via a merge.
